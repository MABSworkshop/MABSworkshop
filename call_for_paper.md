MABS 20201 is part of the AAMAS 2021 conference taking place in London, UK on 3rd-7th of May 2021 

The meeting of researchers from Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) engineering and the social/economic/organisational sciences is extensively recognised for its role in cross-fertilisation, and it has undoubtedly been an important source of inspiration for the body of knowledge that has been produced in the MAS area. The MABS workshop series continues with its goal to bring together researchers interested in MAS engineering, with researchers focused on finding efficient solutions to model complex social systems, in such areas as economics, management, organisational and social sciences in general. In all these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, better designs and systems. 

## Relevant topics

The range of technical issues that MABS has dealt with, and continues to deal with, is quite diverse and extensive. Topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to, the following: 

<ul>
<li> Simulation methodologies </li>

<ul>

<li> standards for MABS </li>

<li> methodologies and simulation languages for MABS </li>

<li> simulation platforms and tools for MABS </li>

<li> visualisation and analytic tools </li>

<li> approaches for large-scale simulations </li>

<li> scalability and robustness in MABS </li>

<li> future challenges in MABS </li>

</ul>

<li> Simulation of social, economic and organizational behaviour  </li>
<ul>

<li> formal and agent models of social, economic and organizational behaviour </li>

<li> cognitive organizations and social simulation </li>

<li> game theory and simulation </li>

<li> social structure, social networks and simulating organizations </li>

<li> simulating social complexity (e.g. structures and norms, social order, emergence of cooperation and coordinated action, self-organisation, the micro-macro link) </li>

</ul>

<li> Applications / Empirical work  </li>
<ul>

<li> MABS in environmental organizations </li>

<li> MABS and cloud computing </li>

<li> agent-based experimental economics </li>

<li> participative-based simulation </li>

<li> MABS and games </li>

<li> MABS in governance and policy-making </li>
</ul>

</ul>

Moreover, in this edition, we will encourage submissions that address **simulation analytics**. In particular, we want to address new methods for sense-making from the results of large complex multi-agent simulations. These topics are important for the MAS/AI/ML communities and for economic/social/organizational scientists using simulations. 

## Target audience
The workshop will provide a forum for social scientists, MAS and AI researchers and developers, and simulation researchers, (1) to assess the current state of the art in the modelling and simulation of social systems and MAS, (2) to identify where existing approaches can be successfully applied, (3) to learn about new approaches and explore future research challenges, and (4) to exchange ideas and knowledge in an inter-disciplinary environment. 

The workshop will be of interest to researchers engaged in modelling and in analysing multi-agent systems, and those interested in applying agent-based simulation techniques to real-world problems. In addition, it will attract researchers committed to cross-cutting research that is complementary to more orthodox modelling approaches.
