To participate in MABS2021 and access the online platform, please register through the main AAMAS conference (https://aamas2021.soton.ac.uk/registration/registration-instructions/) with the workshop registration form available on https://aamas-ws-registration.paperform.co/. Please note that if you are a speaker at MABS2021 you need to submit the speaker registration form which was linked in the acceptance notification, as well as the workshop registration through AAMAS to get access to the online conference system.

Workshop-only registration is free, but we would encourage you to consider joining the main conference.
