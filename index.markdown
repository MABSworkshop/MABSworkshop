<p>The 2022 Multi-Agent-Based Simulation (MABS) workshop is the 23rd of a <a href="http://www.pcs.usp.br/~mabs/">series that began in
1998</a>. Its scientific focus lies in the confluence of social sciences and multi-agent
systems, with a strong application/empirical vein, and its emphasis is stressed on (i) exploratory agent based
simulation as a principled way of undertaking scientific research in the social sciences and (ii) using social
theories as an inspiration to new frameworks and developments in multi-agent systems.
