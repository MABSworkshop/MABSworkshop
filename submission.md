## Submission of papers
Submissions are limited to 12 pages formatted according to the Springer LNCS and must be electronically submitted before the submission deadline through the workshop conference system, which will be available soon.

All contributions will be peer-reviewed by two or three independent PC members. The evaluation criteria of contributions will be based on originality, quality, clarity, and its relevance to the workshop.

All accepted papers will be printed in the AAMAS workshop proceedings. In addition, following the tradition of the previous MABS workshops, we intend to publish the accepted papers, after a further reviewing process, in Springer-Verlag's Multi-Agent-Based Simulation book series, LNAI.
